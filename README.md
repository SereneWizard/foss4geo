[foss4geo_intro.ipynb](https://github.com/SereneWizard/foss4geo/blob/master/foss4geo_intro.ipynb)
This page provides a gentle introduction to the capacity of Python and command lines tools like GDAL to provide geospatial functionality. 

[point_to_shapefile.pynb](https://github.com/SereneWizard/foss4geo/blob/master/point_to_shapefile.ipynb)
Shows how to generate point features from the co-ordinates listed in the .csv file (along with other attributes)

[buffer_multiline.ipynb](https://github.com/SereneWizard/foss4geo/blob/master/Buffer_multiline.ipynb)
Shows how to buffer line feature. The output is a polygon fetaure. The buffer distance has to be provided in the unit of measurement of the line feature file. 

[transform_shapefile.ipynb]()
Shows how to use `pyproj` library to transform shapefile from one co-ordinate system to another.
